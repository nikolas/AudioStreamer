ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------
This is a fork of sprhawk's fork of AudioStreamer (originally written by Matt Gallagher). It's purpose is mostly to add minor improvements, but also remove things I don't find important (shoutcast support and level metering, for instance, have been removed).

Notable changes will be listed in this README in the future.
